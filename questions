# 📄 Wireshark Packet Capture - Task 5 Report

## 🎯 Task Summary

Captured live network traffic using Wireshark and filtered the results to observe different protocols in action.

---

## 🔍 Protocols Identified

### 1. **DNS**
- Used to resolve domain names like `google.com` to IP addresses.
- Filter applied: `dns`
- Observation: DNS Query and Response packets, typically using UDP port 53.

### 2. **HTTP**
- Captured while visiting websites (non-HTTPS).
- Filter applied: `http`
- Observation: GET requests, response codes, and web data.

### 3. **TCP**
- Underlying transport protocol for HTTP.
- Filter applied: `tcp`
- Observation: TCP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), session control.

## 📂 File Details

- `capture-task5.pcap`: Exported packet capture file (duration: ~1 min).
- Interfaces: Captured on `wlan0`.
- Total packets: ~500+ depending on activity.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- **Packet filtering** is very useful to narrow down specific traffic.
- **Each protocol has a unique role** (DNS resolves names, TCP handles sessions, HTTP transfers content).
- **Wireshark can be used for network troubleshooting, protocol analysis, and security inspection.**

---

## ❓ Answers to Key Questions

- **What is a packet?**  
  A packet is a small chunk of data sent across a network.

- **Difference between TCP and UDP?**  
  TCP is reliable and connection-based; UDP is faster but connectionless.

- **Can Wireshark decrypt HTTPS?**  
  Not directly, unless private keys or session secrets are available.
